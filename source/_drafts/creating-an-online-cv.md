Before you start looking for a new job you should get your cv in order. Make it up to date and make it attractive. 

Before I craft a great looking cv I first started looking into option to export my CV from linkedin because I already a nice history documented there. I got a tip from a colleague of mine I could use jsonresume to documented CV there. There are npm packages available that can do this for you
