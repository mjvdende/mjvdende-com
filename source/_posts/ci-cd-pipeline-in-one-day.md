Last week I have had an interview with a recruiter for a role as DevOps lead and the guy asked how much time would it take me to build a CI/CD pipeline for a customer. When I answered that I could set something up for a customer in a day he reacted surprised. 

# JAMstack

For this blog I am going to build a pipeline for a static website. Great recourse researching static website generator is [Staticgen](https://www.staticgen.com/). (*Beware there are loads of generators to choose frome*).

> StaticGen is a leaderboard of the top open-source static site generators

So why JAMstack? Because is getting momentum right now.
